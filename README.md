# GDAT 515: Final Project


## Statement of Work
Using the "Employment status of the civilian noninstitutional population, 1940 to date" data from the USA Bureau of Labor Statistics, a visualization will be created using flexdashboard to show the trends/relationships between the US Civilian noninstitutional population, total employed, and total unemployed over time. Plots should be interactive to showcase further information. 

## Problem Statement
Economists like to be able to predict where the economy, unemployment and such are headed and what relationships (if any) are present. This can be done by studying past economic statistics and trends to get a better understanding of what the future may hold. 

## Technical Objectives
Environment: R

Data Sources: USA Bureau of Labor Statistics
